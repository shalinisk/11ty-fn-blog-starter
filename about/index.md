Each one of us has a voice, sometimes drowned in the dinge of everyday life. And on those rare moments of silence and clarity, the voice rings loud and clear, it's demand just one.

Hello
This is me. This is my voice.

For the more curious ones, my interests include but not limited to:

## Reading, thinking and writing

I read anything that is made up of a string of characters in languages that I can understand. I read billboards, disclaimers, sometimes even terms & conditions.
I also read essays, books, articles and tweets.

## Tinkering

I love coming up with new, bizarre ideas for DIY projects, beat out every single detail and then keep refining it so that it never sees the light of next day.
I have known to do that to my essays too.

## Anything cloud

I love that I get to work as a Cloud Network engineer. It combines 2 of my several passions - network engineering and coding.
